# BigBoori hourly Telegram poster

This bot collects photos posted in a private source channel and posts one photo every hour to @bigboori.

Environment variables:
- BOT_TOKEN = your BotFather token
- SOURCE_CHANNEL_ID = -1004480201131
- TARGET_CHANNEL = @bigboori

The bot generates captions from a built-in caption library, so no paid AI API is required.

Important: Telegram bots receive channel-post updates from the point they are running/added. To populate the bot's collection, post or repost the photos into the source channel after the bot is running.
